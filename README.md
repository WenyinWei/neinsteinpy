# The neinsteinpy Package

The `neinsteinpy` package makes it convenient to analyze the characteristic sinusoidal waves propagating in various kinds of medium. Typical waves in plasma have been given in the code to demonstrate how the package works and other users are free to follow the steps to research on their medium or charcteristic waves of interest.

## Usage Tips

- Unstable APIs

    The APIs are not stable now, please contact Wenyin Wei (wenyin.wei.ww@gmail.com) for face-to-face communication to save your time. Though unstable, they are *easy to understand*, if the user is familiar with Python enough, he or she can easily recognize the techniques and tricks the package uses.

    The jupyter notebooks in the `einsteinpy/nb` folder are complete and self-contained to allow the newcoming users to understand how the code works.

- Consider the users of this package are scientists who spend a lot of time on the decution of physical formulas, *the attributes in any classes in sinupy are intentionally set public without leading underscores* `_`.
